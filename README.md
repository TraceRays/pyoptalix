# pyoptalix

Python Interface to OpTaLiX

pyoptalix will be a 3.13+ library for interfacing with the commercial optical
design code [OpTaLiX](http://www.optenso.com).

The interface is in alpha state and experimental at this point and not yet
available to the general public but to selected alpha users.

I have been an OpTaLiX user for years and often wished to have a Python interface.
[Optenso](http://www.optenso.com) is working on the interface and is providing
constant updates and improvements. Hence, I will update the API capabilities as
they come along.


## Installation

Currently, this is **not** a redistributable package that can be installed via Pip
or Conda. Also, it requires an API extension from [OpTaLiX](http://www.optenso.com),
which is not yet available to the public.


## Feedback

If you are an [OpTaLiX](http://www.optenso.com) user like myself and interested
in a Python API, please let me know what features you like to see. I will provide
feedback to [Optenso](http://www.optenso.com) or contact the company directly so
that they can add it to the request list.
